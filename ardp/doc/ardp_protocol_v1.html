<H4> Octet 0 </H4>

Version number. Its value should be 129 (both highest and lowest order
bits set) for v1.

<H4>Octet 1 </H4>

<UL>

   <LI> Bits 0--1: Unused

   <LI> Bits 2--5: Specify contexts which precede the data area; 
                  Contexts may (but are not required to) be 
                  persistent; this means that they may be set once 
                  per association, and not be included in subsequent
                  packets.

   <LI> Bit 6: UNUSED.  Was originally defined as follows: Privacy protected; indicates that the data field 
               is encrypted. The encryption method is specified 
               and included in the security context. The privacy 
               protected bit tells the receiver that if it doesn't 
               understand the security context, it might as well 
               disregard the data. 

   <LI> Bit 7: UNUSED.  Was originally defined as follows: Integrity protected; it indicates that the security 
               context contains a checksum that applies to the entire 
               data area. 
</UL>

<H4>Octet 2</H4> 

<UL>

   <LI> Bit 0: This packet should be acknowledged.

   <LI> Bit 1: This is a sequenced control packet. It should not be
               delivered to a higher-level application.

   <LI> Bit 2: Total packet count specified in a 2-octet argument that
               follows. 

   <LI> Bit 3: Priority specified in a 2-octet argument (octet 11
	       marks the start of the arguments).

   <LI> Bit 4: Protocol id specified in a 2-octet argument.

   <LI> Bit 5: Maximum window size specified in a 2-octet argument.

   <LI> Bit 6: Wait time specified ina 2-octet argument. A non-zero 
               value for the argument lets the client know that 
               a request might not be processed for the specified time
               period, and that the client should not retry the
	       request. The client may retry sooner if it believes 
               messages have been missed (e.g., gaps in the list of 
               received packets). This is an unsigned quantity
 	       measured in seconds in network order (i.e., octet 
               9 is more significant than octet 10). If unspecified, 
               defaults to current value. A specified value of 0 means
               revert to client-specified backoff algorithm. 

   <LI> Bit 7: OFLAGS, which means that octet 3 should be interpreted
               as an additional set of flags. 
</UL>

<H4>Octet 3 </H4> 

Normally specifies 1 of up to 256 possible options, except when the
OFLAGS bit in octet 1 is turned on, in which case octet 2 is
interpreted as additional set of flags. The exact function of these
additional flags have not yet been specified.
<P>
All options supported by version 0 are also supported in version 1;
additional options have been added.

  <TR><TD>3<TD>Packets received beyond received-through <TD> The rest
of the header after additional data for octet 11 flags is an arbitrary
number of octets.  These are bit-vectors specifying which packets
beyond the received-through specified in this packet have been
received by the sender of this packet.  For example, if the
received-through is set to 43, then we know that packet 44 has not
been received.  The low order bit of the first octet of the additional
field will be turned on if packet 45 has been received, and off if it
has not.  The high-order bit will be turned on if packet 52 has been
received, and off if it has not.  Similarly, the low-order bit of the
second octet of additional information will be turned on if packet 53
has been received, and so on.  The recipient of this information may
choose to ignore it and use a simpler resend strategy.  Similarly,
this information is never required to be sent.

  <TR><TD>4<TD> Redirect (used by servers):The client should send any
unacknowledged packets already sent and all subsequent packets in this
message to a new addresss.  This is designed to be used as a
load-shedding device.  In one common case, this will be the entire
response a server gives to a request, and the client will resend the
entire request to a new server; in the other common case, this will be
used in conjunction with option 6 or 7. <TD>  6 octets.  The first 4
octets are the IP address of the new server, in network byte order.
The next 2 octets are the UDP port to which the request should be
sent, also in network byte order.

  <TR><TD>5<TD> Redirect and notify (used by servers). Like option 4, but
the client's network layer should also notify its caller that all
subsequent requests intended for the old server should be sent to the
new server instead. <TD> Same as option 4.

  <TR><TD>6<TD> Forwarded: This request was received from a
client, and the sender is a server forwarding it to the recipient for
processing.   The recipient should pretend that it received this
message from the sender indicated by the additional fields, not from
the real sender of this message.  (If implemented, this request should be accepted only
from one of a group of trusted hosts.)   This option is intended to be
used by a central server which distributes requests to several subsidiary
servers which do the actual work of processing the request, but which
use the central server as  a contact point.  Presumably, it is cheaper
for the central server to forward the request to the subsidiary
servers over a local area network rather than for the client (who may
be quite far away) to retransmit it.    The central server has done
the job of notifying the original client (through option 4 or 5) that
further requests and retransmissions should go to the new server.
<TD>6 octets: The IP address and port of the original sender of
this message, as in number 4.

<TD>

  <TR><TD>7<TD>Forwarded; Please notify: Like option 6, but the
receiving server should notify the client of the switch (through
option 4 or 5)<TD>6 octets: The IP address and port of the original
sender of this message, as in number 4.

  <TR><TD>8<TD>ARDP version obsolete: We get this message when the peer knows we are using an ARDP version that it does not understand.  This message is only sent in response to an outstanding ARDP request.  This is the version-specific BAD-VERSION message.   The ARDP peer can only send this back if it knows enough about the recipient's ARDP version so that it can recognize the version information in the BAD-VERSION message recipient's original message.  If the peer doesn't recognize the original message's version, then it sends back a version-independent BAD-VERSION message.  (This is a message whose first octet is zero.)
<TD>none

  <TR><TD><a name="option9">9</a><TD>Server to client: Context Failed; Connection refused <TD> Optionally, three 
	octets may follow.  The first is an error subtype code,  the second is the context's service,  and the third is context's mechanism.

<P>
An error subtype code of zero means no particular error subtype has 
been specified.   

No other error subtypes have been assigned yet.

Subtypes of error will include
<ul>
<li> ARDP_CRITICAL_CONTEXT_NOT_SUPPORTED
because some critical context or critical context's service and mechanism (probably the security context) was not understood or is not implemented.  and 
<li> ARDP_CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED because some critical (i.e.,
with the criticality bit set) service failed (could be a checksum or
other integrity check, could be an authentication, could be encryption.  
</ul>	
<p> <strong>Rationale: </strong>
<ul>
<li>We (Katia & Steve, 8/96)  expect that all encrypted messages will have the criticality bit set by the sender; however, this assumption is not built into the code nor is it enforced.
<li>We expect that the only critical context will be the security
context; however, this is not enforced.  Indeed, as of this writing
(8/96), the security context is the only implemented one.
</ul>

The current (8/96) prototype V1 implementation represents (a) with 14
and (b) with 15.

  <TR><TD>10-252<TD>Undefined<TD>Undefined
  
  <TR><TD>253<TD>Request Queue Status<TD> 1 octet.  If bit 0 (low order) is
set, the position in the queue is requested.  If bit 1 is set, the
estimated time until this request will be completed is requested.  The
recipient may ignore this option.

  <TR><TD>254<TD>Response to 253.<TD>1 octet of flags, followed by 1 or 2 additional
fields.  If bit 0 (low order) of the flags is set, the position in the
queue is returned as a 2 octet network byte order representation of an
unsigned quantity.  A value of  \hexnum{FFFF} (all bits turned on) means 
a queue position of \hexnum{FFFF} or further.  (We do not expect this
value to ever be used, but it is included for the sake of
completeness.)  If bit 1 of the flags is set, the estimated 
time until this request will be completed is returned as a  4-octet
network byte order unsigned value, representing a time in seconds.  A
value of \hexnum{FFFFFFFF} (all bits turned on) means a time of
\hexnum{FFFFFFFF} seconds or more.  (We do not expect this to ever be 
used).

<hr size="8">


<H4>Octet 4 </H4> 

Length of this packet's header. The header length does not include the
security context.

<H4>Octets 5--6 </H4> 

A 2-octet quantity specifying this packet's connection id.

<H4>Octet 7--8 </H4> 

A 2-octet quantity specifying this packet's sequence number. If
unspecified, the default is packet number 1. An explicit value of 0
means an unsequenced control packet, which cannot be acknowledged.

<H4>Octets 9--10 </H4> 

Number of packets the sender has received through from the peer.

<H4>Octet 11</H4> 

Marks the start of the arguments. Arguments for octet 1's flags appear
first. Arguments to bit 0 flag appear before arguments to bit 1 flag, 
and so on. Arguments for octet 2 options or arguments for the octet 2
OFLAGS appear next.

<P> 
This ends the ARDP header. 

<H4>Data Area and Security Context<a label="Security Context Semantics"></H4> 

After the header, the remainder of the packet contains data, unless a
security context is specified in octet 1. In this case, the security
context appears at the start of the data area of the packet with the
security context bit turned on. A security context can cross packet
boundaries and is associated with the part of the
transmission/connection from when it was specified until another
security context is specified. 

<P>

Security contexts are usually associated with a range of packets,
instead of just the individual packet in which it is specified.
However, some security contexts, such as a per-packet checksum, are
associated with the individual packet in which they are specified.

<P>

When a new security context is specified, it may either override or
supplement the old one. The specifics of this for subtypes of security
context will be defined later.
