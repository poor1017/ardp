a. request ID: cid
b. packet ID: seq

1. server get req from ardp_pendingQa
2. if receive and parse a request, check to see if it is already on done, partial, or pending
3. if the current request is not complete, check the ardp_partialQ to find the rest of the request
4. if it is the first packet received in the request, and need ack, ack it
5. add the current packet to the current request packet list
6. add the current packet to the end of ardp_partialQ, if exceed the window(20), remove from head
7. continue receive packet until request complete
8. remove from ardp_partialQ, check ardp_runQ for duplicate, add to ardp_pendingQ
9. receive a duplicate request, 
    a. check ardp_doneQ first if discard it
    b. check ardp_partialQ to comprise the complete request and check duplicate
    ---------- request complete ---------
    c. check ardp_runQ, discard the duplicate request
    d. check ardp_pendingQ, discard the duplicate request


1. construct request from msg buffer, add the completed 'sec' packets to the existing msg
2. add the current request to ardp_activeQ
3. send packets one by one, update send_num
4. receive reply, look for the request on ardp_activeQ and remove from ardp_activeQ, add the request to ardp_completeQ
5. not receive reply, if the request need ack, just send ack immediately
6. receive reply time out, half window and retransmit the request, retry count exceed, remove the request
5. if ->seq == 0 (unsequenced control packet), if received_through is smaller than send_num, then retransmit


accept:
1. construct request
2. check on ardp_doneQ
3. check on ardp_partialQ
    1. update prcvd_thru
    2. 


prcocess active:
1. select again and again
2. nothing to receive, check for timeouts
    a. need ack, send ack without data
    b. timeout and retry count is not 0
        1. shrink the window to half
        2. reset the head of all packets in the request, the last ack, prcvd_thru + window_sz == seq ack
        3. update timeout
        4. send the request
    c. count is 0, clean
3. receive the reply
4.
