 * Implementation and Specification Comments:

 * "The members of this structure are: 
    h_name              Official name of the host. [ ... ]"
 * 
 * Under Solaris 2.3, Mitra reports that a short name that is not the fully
 * qualified domain name is being returned in the h_name member.  This makes
 * myhostname() return a name that is not the official name of the host.
 *
 *
 * Problems if we don't get the fully qualified domain name (swa went through
 * all the existing code calling this function to check and make sure no 
 * problems would arise):
 * dirsrv.c: no problem; envar overrides #define overrides myhostname()
 * ftp.c (in vcache): used to construct password for anonymous FTP.  
 * So: no problem.
 * Not used elsewhere in the existing code; future code will be aware of the
 * potential problem.
