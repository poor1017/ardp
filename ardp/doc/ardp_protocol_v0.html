<H2>Fields in the ARDP header (Version 0)</H2>


<H4>Octet 0</H4>
 Version and header length: High order two bits are ARDP
version number mod 4 (this is version 0). Low order six bits are the
header length including octet 0.\footnote{The length of the total
packet, including data, is available via the UDP layer, as are the
port and IP address of the sending host.}

<H4>Octets 1--2</H4>
Connection ID: Defaults to zero.  It must be
specified in the response to any request that specified a non-zero
connection ID.

<H4>Octets 3--4</H4>
Packet number: Defaults to 1 if not specified. A specified
value of 0 indicates an unsequenced control packet which should not
be passed to the application.   Note that unsequenced control packets
cannot request acknowledgements, nor is there any way for the sender
of such a packet to be sure that they have arrived.

<H4>Octets 5--6</H4>
Total number of packets in this message:   Defaults
to 0 if not known, or retains current value if it was provided in any
earlier messages.  If the packet number was also not specified, then
it defaults to 1.  A specified value of 0 means use the default.

<H4>Octets 7--8</H4>
Received through:   Sequence number through which
all packets have been received by the sender of this packet.  Defaults
to current value if specified in previous message. Defaults to 0
otherwise.  The recipient's count of packets received through is
normally monotonically increasing; this keeps the count from being set
backwards in case an out-of-order packet is received.  However, if the
``reset received through'' option (option 2) is specified in octet 12, then it
means reset to 0 (i.e. it forgot or lost the earlier messages).  More
generally, specifying any explicit value for this field along with the
``reset received through'' option resets the peer's count, possibly
backwards.  The recipient should not set its internal value of this
field backwards unless the ``reset received through'' option is set.

<H4>Octets 9--10</H4>
Wait (expected time till response): Defaults to
current value. Specified value of 0 means revert to client-specified
backoff algorithm.  Specifying a non-zero value lets the
client know that a request might not be processed for some time and
that the client should not retry the request until the specified time.
The client may retry sooner if it believes
messages are available which have been missed (e.g., gaps in the list
of received packets).  This is an unsigned
quantity, measured in seconds, in network octet order (i.e., octet 9 is
more significant than octet 10).  A specified value of 65,535
(\(\mbox{FFFF}_{16}\); 
all bits turned on) means greater than or equal to 65,535 seconds
until the next packet.  (We do not expect that this value will ever be
used, but it is defined for the sake of completeness.)   

The client, in its messages, always sets this field to zero.

<H4>Octet 11</H4>
Flags: Octet 11 is a bit vector specifying option flags.
The flags may themselves require additional
fields specific to the flag.  These fields appear at the end of the
header in the order they are needed when reading flags from the low
order bit to the high order bit, followed by any extra fields needed
by the flag specified by the 12th octet.

  <TR><TD>2<TD>Reset peer's received-through count.<TD>Specified in octets 7-8

  <TR><TD>3<TD>Packets received beyond received-through <TD> The rest
of the header after additional data for octet 11 flags is an arbitrary
number of octets.  These are bit-vectors specifying which packets
beyond the received-through specified in this packet have been
received by the sender of this packet.  For example, if the
received-through is set to 43, then we know that packet 44 has not
been received.  The low order bit of the first octet of the additional
field will be turned on if packet 45 has been received, and off if it
has not.  The high-order bit will be turned on if packet 52 has been
received, and off if it has not.  Similarly, the low-order bit of the
second octet of additional information will be turned on if packet 53
has been received, and so on.  The recipient of this information may
choose to ignore it and use a simpler resend strategy.  Similarly,
this information is never required to be sent.

  <TR><TD>4<TD> Redirect (used by servers):The client should send any
unacknowledged packets already sent and all subsequent packets in this
message to a new addresss.  This is designed to be used as a
load-shedding device.  In one common case, this will be the entire
response a server gives to a request, and the client will resend the
entire request to a new server; in the other common case, this will be
used in conjunction with option 6 or 7. <TD>  6 octets.  The first 4
octets are the IP address of the new server, in network byte order.
The next 2 octets are the UDP port to which the request should be
sent, also in network byte order.

  <TR><TD>5<TD> Redirect and notify (used by servers). Like option 4, but
the client's network layer should also notify its caller that all
subsequent requests intended for the old server should be sent to the
new server instead. <TD> Same as option 4.

  <TR><TD>6<TD> Forwarded: This request was received from a
client, and the sender is a server forwarding it to the recipient for
processing.   The recipient should pretend that it received this
message from the sender indicated by the additional fields, not from
the real sender of this message.  (If implemented, this request should be accepted only
from one of a group of trusted hosts.)   This option is intended to be
used by a central server which distributes requests to several subsidiary
servers which do the actual work of processing the request, but which
use the central server as  a contact point.  Presumably, it is cheaper
for the central server to forward the request to the subsidiary
servers over a local area network rather than for the client (who may
be quite far away) to retransmit it.    The central server has done
the job of notifying the original client (through option 4 or 5) that
further requests and retransmissions should go to the new server.
<TD>6 octets: The IP address and port of the original sender of
this message, as in number 4.

<TD>

  <TR><TD>7<TD>Forwarded; Please notify: Like option 6, but the
receiving server should notify the client of the switch (through
option 4 or 5)<TD>6 octets: The IP address and port of the original
sender of this message, as in number 4.

  <TR><TD>8<TD>ARDP version obsolete: We get this message when the peer knows we are using an ARDP version that it does not understand.  This message is only sent in response to an outstanding ARDP request.  This is the version-specific BAD-VERSION message.   The ARDP peer can only send this back if it knows enough about the recipient's ARDP version so that it can recognize the version information in the BAD-VERSION message recipient's original message.  If the peer doesn't recognize the original message's version, then it sends back a version-independent BAD-VERSION message.  (This is a message whose first octet is zero.)
<TD>none

  <TR><TD>9-252<TD>Undefined<TD>Undefined
  
  <TR><TD>253<TD>Request Queue Status<TD> 1 octet.  If bit 0 (low order) is
set, the position in the queue is requested.  If bit 1 is set, the
estimated time until this request will be completed is requested.  The
recipient may ignore this option.

  <TR><TD>254<TD>Response to 253.<TD>1 octet of flags, followed by 1 or 2 additional
fields.  If bit 0 (low order) of the flags is set, the position in the
queue is returned as a 2 octet network byte order representation of an
unsigned quantity.  A value of  \hexnum{FFFF} (all bits turned on) means 
a queue position of \hexnum{FFFF} or further.  (We do not expect this
value to ever be used, but it is included for the sake of
completeness.)  If bit 1 of the flags is set, the estimated 
time until this request will be completed is returned as a  4-octet
network byte order unsigned value, representing a time in seconds.  A
value of \hexnum{FFFFFFFF} (all bits turned on) means a time of
\hexnum{FFFFFFFF} seconds or more.  (We do not expect this to ever be 
used).

<H4>Octets 13 and above</H4>

Fields specific to particular flags and options. <P>

First, additional data fields  specific to the flags in octet 11
should be specified. <P>

<H4>Next Octets</H4>

Additional Address Information (if Additional
Address Information flag specified):  The first octet specifies the
type of additional address information.  The next octet specifies the
length of the address information, from 0 to 255 octets.The
entire 255 octets are not available for address information, since they
are part of the header, and the maximum header length header is
limited to 64 octets. <P>

Its length does not include the two octets that specify type and
length.  The following octets contain the address information itself,
and its format is dependent upon the type of address information.

<H4>Next 2 octets</H4>
Priority (if Priority flag specified): <br>
These octets are a signed integer representing the priority of the
request.  Not all implementations understand this message, and many
that do will not honor requests for expedited handling.  Negative
numbers indicate expedited handling while higher numbers indicate
greater delays.  A priority of 0 is normal.  Implementation detail:
the priority is currently tagged onto all packets sent; this isn't
necessary, but it's easy. <P>

<H4>Next 2 octets</H4>

Protocol ID (if Protocol ID flag specified):
These octets identify the interpretation of the data carried in the
packet.  The default, or an explicitly specified value of 0,  mean
that it is not specified, but has been agreed upon externally (i.e.
the applications will know).  <P>

<H4>Next octets</H4>

Any data specific to the option set by octet 12
should be specified.  This is the data specified in the ``additional
fields'' column of the table ``Value of flags for octet 12.'' <P>
