<TITLE> ARDP Library Interface Description </TITLE>
<H1> ARDP Library Interface Description</H1>

Below we provide a description of the interfaces to the ARDP library.

<P>
The ARDP v1 API (which is implemented and distributed as ARDP Release
1.0) is a superset of the ARDP v0 API.
<P>
This page's documentation covers the ARDP Version 0
facilities in the Prospero 5.3 release.  Programmers using ARDP
release 1.0 or Prospero release 5.4 will also want to read <A
HREF="http://gost.isi.edu/info/ardp/ardp_api_v1.html"> ARDP - API
(Version 1)</A>.
<P>
Functions in the library that are not described here should be 
considered internal and should not be called by the application. 
In the functions that follow, more documentaton can be found in the 
header preceding the function in the source code. 

<P>
<h2>ARDP Errors</h2>
<P>
Many functions are listed as returning an <tt>ardp_errcode</tt>.  In
the Prospero 5.3 release, this is actually an <tt>int</tt>; the
type was changed to <tt>ardp_errcode</tt>, a typedef for <tt>enum
ardp_errcode</tt>, in later releases.  These errors, taken from
<tt>ardp.h</tt>, are as follows.  The numeric values should not be relied
upon; use the symbolic names instead:
<P>
<pre>
/* ARDP library error status codes. */
/* These must remain in the range 0-20 for compatibility with the Prospero
   File System. */
/* Note that ARDP_SUCCESS must remain 0, due to code implementation. */
enum ardp_errcode {
    ARDP_SUCCESS = 0,		/* Successful completion of call    */
    ARDP_PORT_UNKN = 1,		/* UDP port unknown                 */
    ARDP_UDP_CANT = 2,		/* Can't open local UDP port        */
    ARDP_BAD_HOSTNAME = 3,	/* Can't resolve hostname           */
    ARDP_NOT_SENT = 4,		/* Attempt to send message failed   */
    ARDP_SELECT_FAILED = 5,	/* Select failed	            */
    ARDP_BAD_RECV = 6,		/* Recvfrom failed 	            */
    ARDP_BAD_VERSION = 7,       /* bad version # in rdgram protocol */
    ARDP_BAD_REQ = 8,		/* Inconsistent request structure   */
    ARDP_TIMEOUT = 9,		/* Timed out - retry count exceeded */
    ARDP_REFUSED = 10,		/* Connection refused by server     */
    ARDP_FAILURE = 11,		/* Unspecified ARDP failure         */
    ARDP_TOOLONG = 12,		/* Buffer too long for packet       */
    ARDP_TIMER_FAILED = 13,	/* A call to gettimeofday() failed.
				   (this is ARI's addition; I'm not
				   sure that it's needed --swa) */
    ARDP_CRITICAL_CONTEXT_NOT_SUPPORTED = 14, /* for ardp-v1 contexts */
    ARDP_CRITICAL_SERVICE_FAILED = 15,
    ARDP_CONTEXT_FAILURE = 16,	/* more general than the CONTEXT ones above;
				   more specific than ARDP_FAILURE (or
				   ARDP_REFUSED, in some situations)  */
};

typedef enum ardp_errcode ardp_errcode;

<P>
<h2>ARDP client functions</h2>
<P>
The following functions are exported by the ARDP library for use by
the client side of a connection:

<!C! Documentation conventions:  function names are STRONG, arguments
are in typewriter text TT>
<UL>

  <LI> <tt>void</tt> <STRONG> ardp_abort(<tt>RREQ req</tt>) </STRONG>: 
       Aborts the specified request, sending an
       abort message to the server if currently
       active.  If <tt>req</tt> is null,<strong>ardp_abort</strong>
       will send aborts to servers for all active requests. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_abort_on_int(<tt>void</tt>) </STRONG>:
        Sets interrupt handler to abort any 
       pending requests. </LI>
<P>

<LI><STRONG>int ardp_priority</STRONG>:  Default priority for outgoing ARDP requests.  Default is 0.  
The default priority can be overridden for a particular connection by setting the <tt>priority</tt> member of the associated RREQ structure.
<P>
</LI>

<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_process_active() </STRONG>: 
       Processes new responses to active requests.
       If making an asynchronous request (i.e. if the ttwait passed to 
	ardp_send() 
       does not equal ARDP_WAIT_TILL_TO), then this
       function must be called periodically, either
       automatically within ardp_retrieve, explicitly, 
       or initiated by an interrupt when
       a response becomes available on the UDP port. 
	This functions is also used on the server side.  Normally a
        server does not call it directly, since it is automatically called
        by the <strong>ardp_retrieve<i>*</i>()</strong> family of functions</LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG>int ardp_retrieve(RREQ req,int ttwait) </STRONG>: 
       Poll for, or wait <strong>ttwait</strong> microseconds for the
        pending request <strong>req</strong> to complete.  If <strong>ttwait</strong> is
        -1, <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong> blocks.  
       <strong>req</strong> is normally a pointer to an outstanding 
	ARDP request.   ardp_retrieve() returns an error code.   The
	successfully completed request <tt>req</tt> is removed from
	the ardp_completeQ.  
<P> Earlier versions of this documentation claimed that <tt>NOREQ</tt>
is not acceptable as an argument to <tt>ardp_retrieve()</tt>.  In
fact, passing <tt>NOREQ</tt> is a query about whether any requests
have completed (successfully or unsuccessfully).  We return
ARDP_SUCCESS if a complete request is available.  (However, unlike in
the case where <it>req</it> is a specific request, we do not remove it
from the completeQ.)
<P>
	ardp_retriev() will perform appropriate retransmissions for
	all items on the <tt>ardp_activeQ</tt> if any timeouts occur
	during the <strong>ttwait</strong> period.  (This was not the
	case before February 1997). 
<P>
	Returns <tt>ARDP_BAD_REQ</tt> if called on an RREQ that is not
	on the activeQ or the completeQ.  
	If no request is ready when the timeout expires, returns
	<tt>ARDP_PENDING</tt>. 

  </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG>RREQ ardp_retrieve_nxt_nonblocking(void)</STRONG>:
	Like calling ardp_retrieve(), but not specifying any request, 
	and with no wait for a message.
	Returns NOREQ or any completed message, if one is there.

<P>
	
  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_send(req,dname,dest,ttwait) </STRONG>: 
       Sends the request <tt>req</tt> to the host with domain name
       <tt>dname</tt> or socket address <tt>dest</tt>, and waits
       <strong>ttwait</strong> microseconds for a response.  
       <tt>ttwait</tt> may also be the constant
       <strong>ARDP_WAIT_TILL_TO</strong> (or -1); this means that
       <strong>ardp_send()</strong> should wait until the ARDP protocol's
       timeout happens. Passing <tt>ttwait</tt> as 0 means
       <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong> is not called and
       <strong>ardp_send()</strong> returns immediately. </LI> 
<P>


  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_set_retry(to,rt) </STRONG>: 
       Set retry initial time out (to <strong>to</strong> seconds).
        Specify that you want <strong>rt</strong> retries.  Calling
        this function is identical to the sequence of code:<br>
<tt>ardp_config.default_timeout = <strong>to</strong>;<br>
ardp_config.default_retry = <strong>rt</strong>;<br>
</tt>
        
  </LI>

</UL>

<h2>ARDP server functions</h2><P>
The following functions and variables are exported by the ARDP library for use by
the server side of a connection:

<UL>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_accept() </STRONG>: 
       Accepts new requests and places on appropriate
       queues for subsequent processing.  This must be called
       periodically, either explicitly, or initiated by an interrupt 
       when a request becomes available on the UDP port. </LI>
<P>
	ardp_accept() does not block.  It does not call <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong>; keep this in mind if you are writing a program that acts as a client and as a server.
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_bind_port(const char *portname) </STRONG>:
       <strong>portname</strong> is the service name (in <tt>/etc/services</tt>) or number (a string in the format 
	<tt>"#<i>decimal-port-number</i>"</tt>) of a port to be opened, on which the
       server will listen for requests. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> RREQ ardp_get_nxt(<tt>void</tt>) </STRONG>: 
       Returns the next request to be processed.
       If none available, it will block until one is received.  Calls
       <strong>ardp_accept()</strong>. 
<P>
	<strong>ardp_get_nxt()</strong> does not call <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong>.  It is not recommended that you use it if you are writing a program that acts as a client and as a server and there might be any outstanding (asynchronous) client requests. 
</LI>
<p>
  <LI> <STRONG> RREQ ardp_get_nxt_nonblocking(void) </STRONG>:
       Returns the next request to be processed.
       If none available, it will return the constant
       <STRONG>NOREQ</STRONG>.   Calls <strong>ardp_accept()</strong>.
	Does not call <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong>
</LI>

<P>



  <LI> <STRONG>int ardp_redirect(RREQ req, struct sockaddr_in *target) </STRONG>:
       Sends a redirect to the client indicating the the request
       <strong>req</strong> should be sent to a new target server
       identified in the second argument.  For now, redirections
       should only occur before any request packets have been
       acknowledged, or response packets sent.  
</LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_respond(RREQ req, int opt) </STRONG>: 
       Used by a server to send the current response
       packet once filled in.  It will add the packet 
       to the transmission queue, and send it.  To
       indicate completion of a response, the
       ARDP_RESP_COMPLETE option should be specified.
       If the ARDP_RESP_NOSEND option is specified,
       the packet will be added to the transmission queue
       but not sent. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_refuse(RREQ req) </STRONG>: 
       Causes the request specified by <strong>req</strong> to be refused and
       notification sent to the client. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_reply(RREQ req, int flags, const char *message) </STRONG>:
       Queues message (appending it to the req structure)
       and possibly sends it and other queued data to the
       client.  Will call ardp_respond() if any
       completed packets can be sent (i.e., sends a
       partial response  to speed up client/server
       interaction). Message is a null-terminated buffer.
       Can't use this interface to send binary data
       that might contain nulls;  see
       <strong>ardp_breply()</strong> below.
</LI>
<P>
                        
   <LI> <STRONG> int ardp_breply(RREQ req, int flags, const char
*message, int len)</strong>:
	
        Send a reply to a request; the reply might contain binary
       data.

       <strong>ardp_breply</strong> takes a request to which a reply
       is to be sent,
   	a flags field, the contents of the reply message,
	   and a length count for the message.
	<strong>ardp_breply()</strong>  then adds
	 the response to the output queue for the request.

	 A length count of 0 indicates that the buffer is null-terminated.
	 (implementation note: by passing the 0 down to ardp_add2req, we
	  allow there to be only one pass through the buffer instead of 2.)

	If the ARDP_REPL_COMPLETE flag has been specified, all data is sent.
 Otherwise, 
 the response is buffered pending
 subsequent calls to <strong>ardp_breply()</strong>. 
 <strong>ardp_breply()</strong> immediately sends any full packets in
the buffered response.

 The lower level function (ardp_respond) assigns packet numbers and 
 tags outgoing packets if necessary for a multi packet response.
	
<strong>ardp_reply()</strong>
calls <strong>ardp_breply()</strong> internally.


<P>
	
  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_rwait(RREQ req, int timetowait, int qpos, int stime) </STRONG>:
       This function is called by a server to specify
       a server requested time to wait for a response.  
       This value is returned to the client which
       will treat it as an acknowledgment and will
       defer subsequent timeouts and retries until
       waiting <strong>timetowait</strong> seconds.  Non-zero values
       of qpos and stime will cause the current
       the specified queue position and expected
       system time to be provided to the client in
       the same message. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_set_queuing_policy(int(*pf)(RREQ r1, r2),override) </STRONG>:
       Sets a function used to determine queue
       ordering on the server. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_set_prvport(int fd) </STRONG>: 
       Sets a file descriptor that has already been
       opened as the privileged input port on which the server
       will listen for requests. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> int ardp_acknowledge(req) </STRONG>: 
       Sends an acknowledgment message to the client indicating that
       the server received a complete multi-packet request from the
       client. 
       </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG>char *          (*ardp_vlog)(int type, RREQ req, const char *format, va_list ap)</STRONG>  If you are writing a server and want the ARDP library to log information, you need to set this function-valued variable to some logging function.  Its initial value is NULL.
	<strong>type</strong> is a logging message type specified in 
<tt>gl_log_msgtypes.h</tt>.  <strong>req</strong> is the request which triggered this call to the logging function; it may be NOREQ.  <strong>format</strong> is a format string acceptable to the stdio library <strong>printf()</strong> function (or the gostlib <strong>qsprintf()</strong> function).  <strong>ap</strong> refers to the arguments to <strong>printf()</strong>.
<P>

<LI><STRONG>void     (*ardp_newly_received_additional)(RREQ nreq)</STRONG>:
	This function-valued variable may be set if you wish additional processing to be performed (e.g., prioritization) on a complete ARDP request that the server has just received.  Its default value is NULL. </LI>
<P>


</UL>

<h2>ARDP client and server interfaces</h2>
The following functions are exported by the ARDP library for use
by either the client and the server sides of a connection:

<UL>
 
  <LI> <STRONG> RREQ ardp_get_nxt_all(enum ardp_gna_rettype *rettype) </STRONG>: 
        This function is intended to be used by programs which are
        acting both as ARDP clients and as ARDP servers.
        It acts as a combination of
        <STRONG>ardp_get_nxt()</strong> and
        <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong>.  If it returned a response
        (acted as <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong>),
        <strong>*rettype</strong> will be set to
        <strong>ARDP_CLIENT_PORT</strong>.  If it returned a new
        request for the server, <strong>*rettype</strong> will be set
        to <strong>ARDP_SERVER_PORT</strong>.
       If nothing available, it will block until one is received. 
<p>
	It blocks without calling <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong> appropriately.  No retransmissions occur until just before it returns.  If you don't want this to happen, then call <strong>ardp_get_nxt_all_timeout()</strong> with
a <strong>ttwait</strong> argument of <strong>ARDP_WAIT_TILL_TO</strong>


</LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> RREQ ardp_get_nxt_all_timeout(enum ardp_gna_rettype *rettype, 
	int ttwait, int priority)</strong>

	Acts as <tt>ardp_get_nxt_all()</tt>, with extensions:
	<strong>ttwait</strong> specifies a timeout interval in
        microseconds.  -1 (ARDP_WAIT_TILL_TO) means wait forever.  The client should set
	<strong>priority</strong> to one of the two
        distinguished values <strong>ARDP_CLIENT_PORT</strong> or
        <strong>ARDP_SERVER_PORT</strong>.   This indicates whether
        <strong>ardp_get_nxt_all_timeout()</strong> will first check the client port
        for replies or the server port for new requests.
<p>	
	It calls <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong> appropriately.
	</li>        
<P>	
	
  <LI> <STRONG> void ardp_initialize(void) </STRONG>:
     This function must be called before using the ARDP library.
     It initializes <tt>ardp_config</tt>, the structure where the ARDP library looks for its
     configuration information.  If you aren't using the pconfig
routines in gostlib, you should still call <tt>ardp_initialize()</tt>, to keep
<tt>ardp_config</tt> from being full of junk.
<p>
<tt>ardp_initialize()</tt> also initializes the ARDP library's MUTEXES; these
are important for multi-threaded programs.
<p>
<tt>ardp_initialize()</tt> should not be called more than once during
the program's execution.  (There is some code around that does call it
more than once, or calls <tt>p_initialize()</tt> in Prospero more than
once.  This was never correct, although it usually works.  It will
break multi-threaded code.) 
<P><tt>ardp_initialize()</tt> should be called after you have
read in any command-line arguments with
<tt>p_command_line_preparse(&argc, argv)</tt> (q.v.).  If you haven't
called this, then an error may be signalled.  If you call
<tt>p_command_line_preparse()</tt> too late, then an error may be
signalled.  If you call <tt>ardp_initialize()</tt>, or a function that
calls it, more than once, then an error may be signalled.  
(The more robust thing to do would be to make it accept being
called multiple times, and we plan to add that functionality when convenient.).
<P>

 
<P>
  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_add2req(RREQ req, int flags, const char *buf, int len) </STRONG>:
       Adds arbitrary data (including text) to a request which will 
       subsequently
       be sent to the peer, and returns. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> RREQ ardp_rqalloc(void) </STRONG>:  
       Allocate a new request structure. If the user set an auxiliary
       allocating-function  with <strong>ardp_rqappalloc()</strong>,
       <strong>ardp_rqalloc()</strong> will set the new request's
       <tt>app.ptr</tt> member to the return value from invoking that
       function. </LI> <P>
       

  <LI> <STRONG>void ardp_rqappalloc(void * (* appallocfunc)(void))</strong>: see <strong>ardp_rqalloc()</strong>. </LI>
<P>

  <LI> <STRONG> ardp_rqfree(RREQ req) </STRONG>: 
       Free a request structure.   If the user set an auxiliary
       freeing-function  with <strong>ardp_rqappfree()</strong>,
       <strong>ardp_rqfree()</strong> will invoke that function with
       <strong>req</strong>'s <tt>app.ptr</tt> function as its argument.
       </LI> <P>
       
  <LI> <STRONG>void ardp_rqappfree(void (* appfreefunc)(void
       *))</strong>: see <strong>ardp_rqfree()</strong>. </LI>

</LI>
<P>

 <LI> <STRONG>void ardp_rreq_to_in(RREQ rreq, INPUT in,
       ardp_rreq_to_in_aux_INPUT in_aux)</strong>:
	Lets you feed RREQ structures to the <tt>gl_parse</tt> family of
       functions in <tt>gostlib</tt>.
</li> <P>

</UL>


The following functions and variables are used internally by the ARDP
library; we are mentioning them so that users of ARDP will not be
confused by finding them in the ARDP source code and for the
convenience of those wishing to do further ARDP development.  Some of
them may also be useful to applications writers in special
circumstances.

<! XXX The following is inconsistent in its use of /li -- we really don't need it at all, Katia thinks 9/96. >

<UL>
   <li><strong>ardp_headers()</strong></li>: called by <strong>ardp_process_active()</strong> and <strong>ardp_send()</strong> before (re)transmitting packets.

<P>

   <li><strong>ardp_hostname2addr(const char *hostname, struct sockaddr_in *hostaddr)</strong>: called by <strong>ardp_send()</strong>.  This
	 function serves as a thread-safe version of <strong>gethostbyname()</strong>;
	 <strong>gethostbyname()</strong> is not a re-entrant function since it uses 
	static data.  <strong>ardp_hostname2addr()</strong> also caches 
	DNS values for efficiency.  It will cache up to <strong>DNSCACHE_MAX</strong> (constant defined in <tt>ardp.h</tt>) entries.
<P>
	
   <li><tt>ardp_errcode</tt> <strong>ardp_hostname2name_addr(const
   char *<i>hostname_arg</i>, char **<i>official_hnameGSP</i>, struct
   sockaddr_in *<i>hostaddr_arg</i>)</strong>:
   <br>
   Called by <tt>ardp_hostname2addr()</tt>.  Thread-safe.  Returns the
   host's address in <tt>hostaddr_arg</tt>, and the official hostname in
   <tt>official_hnameGSP.  hostaddr_arg</tt> and
   <tt>official_hnameGSP</tt> may be NULL pointers. 
   It is defined and reasonable to call <tt>ardp_hostname2name_addr()</tt> with
   both arguments NULL; this causes a lookup to be made and entered
   into the cache.
   <P>
   We usually cache the official hostname as well.  This will also
   cache numeric addresses, which can be useful.
   <P> The <i>hostname_arg</i> may in one of the three forms:
   <ul>
	<li> 1) "<i>hostname</i>"
	<li> 2) "<i>hostname</i><tt>:</tt><i>port-no</i>"
	<li> 3) "<i>hostname</i><tt>(</tt><i>port-no</i><tt>)</tt>"
   </ul>
   If <i>port-no</i> is not specified (in the first form above), then
   <tt>ardp_hostname2name_addr()</tt> will return with
   <tt>hostaddr_arg->sin_port</tt> set to zero.  If <i>port-no</i> is
   specified, then <tt>hostaddr_arg->sin_port</tt> will be set to the
   decimal integer value of <i>port-no</i>. 
   This function ignores <tt>ardp_config.default_port</tt> and
   <tt>ardp_config.default_peer</tt>; those are examined at higher levels. 


   <P>
   <li> <tt>ardp_errcode</tt> <strong>ardp_init(void)</strong>:  Called by
	<strong>ardp_send()</strong> to bind the port on which the
	client listens for replies.  <!C! Until 9/96, it could not be called twice.>
	<tt>ardp_init()</tt> may be called more than once.  The semantics 
	are that on each subsequent call the old client port will be
	closed and a new one opened and bound.  
<p>
	<TT>ardp_init()</tt> tries first to bind a privileged port.  It tries
	up to <strong>ardp_config.num_privp</strong> ports, starting at 
	<strong>ardp_config.first_privp</strong>, before giving up and
	binding a non-privileged port. 

	<P>
	<strong>ardp_init()</strong> binds the port's address to the
	hosts's IP address; if there is more than one IP interface on
	the host, then the interface associated with the primary
	hostname is used.  This means that all packets coming from the
	host (even if they would normally be tagged with the address
	of an alternate IP interface) will nevertheless be tagged with
	the host's primary IP address.  Presumably, therefore, the
	responses might be sent by an inefficient route back to the
	'primary address' rather than to the appropriate IP address as
	would normally be automatically selected by client's internal
	routing table.
	<P>
	The bound port's IP Address and UDP port number are stored in 
	 the global variable: <br> 
	<tt>struct sockaddr_in </tt><strong>ardp_client_address_port</strong>.
	<br>
	This variable <!C! XXX which should be documented separately at some point,>
	is all zeroes until <tt>ardp_init()</tt> sets it.
	<P>	
	The file descriptor of the newly bound port is in the global variable:<br>
	<tt>int</tt> <strong>ardp_port</strong>
	<br>

	<strong>ardp_init()</strong> returns: 
	<ul>
		<li><strong>ARDP_UDP_CANT</strong> if one of the
		socket system calls failed.  In this case,
		<strong>ardp_client_address_port</strong> will also be
		set to all zeroes and <strong>ardp_port</strong> will
		retain its value of -1 (meaning
		<i>uninitialized</i>). 

		<li><strong>ARDP_SUCCESS</strong> on successful completion.  

	</ul>	
<P>

	<h4>Multi-threading:</h4> 
	This function is currently not written to be thread-safe.
	Indeed, it would be difficult to design a thread-safe

ARDP's configurable parameters are defined in a global data structure named
<tt>ardp_config</tt>.  This structure is initially filled in by
<tt>ardp_initialize()</tt>, which uses the 
<em>p_config</em> routines of <em>gostlib</em>.  After your program
calls <strong>ardp_initialize()</strong>, you may set these members
directly.

You will normally not bother setting most of these parameters; skip
this section if you are just learning to use ARDP.

The members of <tt>ardp_config</tt> are:

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>char *default_peer</STRONG>:
	Name (in <tt>/etc/services</tt>) of the port
<strong>ardp_send()</strong> will use by default, unless one is
explicitly given.  Overridden if <strong>default_port</strong> is set.

<P>
<LI><STRONG>int default_port</STRONG>:
Number of the port <strong>ardp_send()</strong> will use by default.
Overrides <strong>default_peer</strong>.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>int default_timeout</STRONG>:
Number of seconds before trying to retransmit a request.
To override this for a particular connection, set the <tt>timeout</tt> 
member of the associated RREQ structure.   
<P>
<LI><STRONG>int default_retry</STRONG>:
Number of times to retry a request (client).
To override this for a particular connection, set the <tt>retries</tt> 
member of the associated RREQ structure.   
<P>
<LI><STRONG>int default_window_sz</STRONG>:   Peer window size 
ardp will use for its default flow-control strategy.   This is the
window size we assume our peer will accept in the absence of an
explicit request.  Default value is 16 packets.
To override this for a particular connection, set the <tt>pwindow_sz</tt> 
member of the associated RREQ structure.   

<P>
<LI><STRONG>int max_window_sz</STRONG>:
The largest window size we will ever use, no matter what the peer
tells us.  By default this is 256 packets.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>int first_privp</STRONG>:
(Client only): First privileged local port to try to send from; an
ARDP client uses this when it is running as root.  This facility can
be used to provide security similar to that of the Berkeley "r"
commands.
<P>

<LI><STRONG>int num_privp</STRONG>:
(Client only) Number of privileged ports to try before giving up and letting the operating system assign us a nonprivileged port.
</UL>
<P>

<h2>Additional ARDP interfaces (left out of the docs. before 8/14/97)</h2>
<P>
<uL>
<P>
<li><tt>u_int32_t</tt> <strong>myaddress(<tt>void</tt>)</strong>: This
returns a 32-bit integer which is the 32-bit IP (Internet Protocol)
address of the host this function is called on.

<P>
<li><tt>const char *</tt> <strong>myhostname(<tt>void</tt>)</strong>:
The host name of the host this function is called on.

<P>
<li><tt>const char *</tt><strong>unixerrstr(<tt>void</tt>)</strong>:
This is the printed string associated with the error code in the C
library's <tt>errno</tt> (variable) facility.

<P><li><tt>int <strong>ardp_debug</strong></tt>: This variable is zero by
default.  Setting to values up to twelve (12) means that the ARDP
library will print additional diagnostic and progress information on
the <tt>stderr</tt> output stream.  The most convenient value to set
it to is often nine (9); at values of 9 or greater, it will cause
the text of all packets sent back and forth.

 <P><li><tt>RREQ</tt> <strong>ardp_partialQ, ardp_pendingQ, ardp_runQ,  ardp_doneQ</strong>:
<A NAME="queues"></a>
These queues are used on the ARDP server.  Very few users will ever
want to examine them, and they should more properly be considered
internal.  When an ARDP server has received some packets  of a
request, but does not have a complete request yet, an <tt>RREQ</tt> structure
with some fields still blank is on the
<strong>ardp_partialQ</strong>.  When the last packet needed to
complete a request is received, the server moves the request to
<strong>ardp_pendingQ</tt>.  When the request begins processing (when
it is returned from one of the <strong>ardp_get_nxt</strong> family of
functions), then it is moved to <strong>ardp_runQ</strong>.  When the
server program is done processing, it indicates that it has completed
processing the request by giving it as an argument to one of:
 <ul>
<li><strong>ardp_respond()</strong> with the <tt>ARDP_RESP_COMPLETE</tt>
option, 
<li><strong>ardp_refuse()</strong>, 
<li><strong>ardp_redirect()</strong>), 
</ul>then the request is moved to the <tt>ardp_doneQ</tt>.
<P>The queues are also discussed <a href="ardp_faq.html#queues">in the ARDP FAQ</a>

<P> <li><tt>RREQ</tt> <strong>ardp_activeQ, ardp_completeQ:</strong>  These
queues are used on the ARDP client.  Once a message has been sent, its
RREQ is put on the <tt>ardp_activeQ</tt>.  Either when the message has
timed out, or when a complete reply has been received by the client,
then <tt>ardp_process_active()</tt> puts the message's RREQ onto 
the <tt>ardp_completeQ</tt>.   RREQs are removed from the
<tt>ardp_completeQ</tt> by <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong>,
<strong>ardp_retrieve_nxt_nonblocking()</strong>, and the
<strong>ardp_get_nxt_all</strong> functions that include the functionality
of <strong>ardp_retrieve()</strong>.
<P>The queues are also discussed <a href="ardp_faq.html#queues">in the ARDP FAQ</a>
