      <h1>ARDP Security Context Format</h1>

This document reflects the implementation of the security context as
      of March 18, 1996.   <!We expect this will be the same as the
publicly released version of the documentation.  >A current version of
this document may be found via the ARDP home page, at URL <a href="http://gost.isi.edu/info/ardp"><tt>http://gost.isi.edu/info/ardp</tt></a>.

The current format is implemented in
      <tt><a href="src/ardp_req_security.c">ardp_rec_security.c</a></tt> in the ARDP source distribution.

<a href="ardp_protocol_v1.html#Security Context Semantics">
The ARDP v1 protocol specification has a section describing how the security context is applied to an ARDP message.</a>
      
<P>
The first four bytes of the security context are the length of the
	entire security context in bytes or octets.  They represent a four-byte
	unsigned integer in network byte order.  This count includes the
	four bytes that specify the length of the context.
<P>
The rest of the security context is composed of zero or more blocks.
	These blocks may cross packet boundaries.  
	Each security context block starts with one byte, the <i>service
	byte</i>.  The bits of the <i>service byte</i> are allocated 
	as follows: 
<P>
<TABLE BORDER>
  <CAPTION> Bits of the Service Byte </CAPTION>
  <TR><TH ROWSPAN=1>Bit Number<TH>Meaning<TH>Additional Information
  <TR><TD>7<TD> Criticality bit<TD> If this bit is set and the
	    recipient either does not understand this security service and
	    mechanism, or some aspect of processing it fails (e.g.,
	    unable to verify a checksum), then the
	    recipient should refuse the message with <a
href="ardp_protocol_v1.html#option9">ARDP option 9</a>.
<P> If the criticality bit is not set in a block of the security context, the
context's recipient may ignore any part of that block that is not understood.
  <TR><TD>6<TD>Me<TD>This block contains security context information
	    that the originator generated.	    
  <TR><TD>5<TD>You<TD>The recipient is requested to generate a
	    security context block with this service and mechanism.
  <TR><TD>4--0<TD>Service Code<TD>A numeric code representing a
      security service.	   
</TABLE>
<P>
The currently defined <i>security services</i> are <strong>PAYMENT,
	  INTEGRITY, AUTHENTICATION,
ENCRYPTION.</strong> and <strong>CLASS-OF-SERVICE</strong>.  
<P>
Most <i>security services</i> can be performed by different algorithms
or <i>mechanisms</i>.  For example, authentication may be done, among
other means, via Kerberos or via simple passwords (as FTP and TELNET
do).  The second octet of a security context block indicates the particular
<i>mechanism</i> implementing the <i>service</i> specified by the
first octet.
<P>
The numeric codes for security services and mechanisms are defined in
the table below.  They may also be seen in the ARDP source code, in <tt><a
href="src/ardp_sec.h">ardp_sec.h</a></tt>.  
	
<P>
The next four bytes are the length of the arguments to this block.
	This is an unsigned integer in network byte order.
	Some security contexts (especially ones being requested but
	not sent, where the <i>you</i> bit is set but the <i>me</i> bit is not)
	will have no arguments.
<P>
After this length count, that many bytes of arguments are present.
The arguments and their format are interpreted by each security
service and mechanism.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER>
<CAPTION>Defined Security Context Services and Mechanisms</CAPTION>
<TR><TH ROWSPAN=1>Mechanism (value)<TH>Service (value)<TH>C Identifier<TH>Argument Format
<TR><TD>INTEGRITY (2)	<TD>INTEGRITY_CHECKSUM (0x01)<TD>
	<tt>integrity_checksum</tt><TD>If the ME bit is set, the
argument is four bytes long.  It is the four-byte CRC checksum of the
payload.  If 
the ME bit is not set, the arguments field has zero length.  <P> If the
<i>you</i> bit is set, the sender expects that the response it receives will
contain a 4-byte CRC checksum for the payload.
<TR><TD>INTEGRITY (2)	<TD>INTEGRITY_KERBEROS (0x22)<TD><tt>integrity_kerberos</tt>
<TD>
From the client to the server, the argument is:
<ul>
<li> A four byte
count in network byte order, <i>x</i>.   
<li> Next is an XXXXXX
structure, as defined in <a href="#where-krb5-protocol-specification">the Kerberos v5 protocol spec</a>.  The XXXXXX
structure is <i>x</i> bytes long.  The XXXXXX
structure is the same as the output of the Kerberos v5 library call 
<tt>krb5_mk_req()</tt>.
<li> Next is a Kerberos YYYYYY structure, the
same as the output of <tt>krb5_mk_safe()</tt>.  The length of the
YYYYYY structure is implicitly encoded by the total length of the
arguments minus <i>x</i>.
</ul>
<P>
From the server to the client, the argument is:
<ul>
<li> A four-byte 
unsigned integer in network byte order, <i>depends-on-authenticator-number</i>.This is a reference to the Kerberos authenticator that was used to
produce the krb5_mk_safe().
<li> A four-byte 
count in network byte order, <i>x</i>.   
<li> Next is a Kerberos
protocol ZZZZZZ structure.  (Implementors: This structure is the same
as the output of the Kerberos v5 library call <tt>krb5_mk_rep()</tt>,
<i>x</i> bytes long.)  
<li> Next is a Kerberos protocol YYYYYY
structure (Implementers: This is the output of <tt>krb5_mk_safe()</tt>.)
</ul>
<TR><TD>AUTHENTICATION (3)      
    <TD>AUTHENTICATION_KERBEROS (0x01)
    <TD><tt>authentication_kerberos</tt>
    <TD>From the client to the server, the argument is the
    <em>authenticator</em> produced as the output of the krb5_mk_req() Kerberos
    library call.  The length of the authenticator is known because it
    is the same as the length of the total argument.

<P> The <em>authenticator</em> is all that is required for
Kerberos authentication.  

<TR><TD>CLASS_OF_SERVICE (5)	<TD>CLASS_OF_SERVICE_TAGS (0x00)<TD>
	<tt>class_of_service_tags</tt><TD>
The arguments are two null-terminated ASCII strings.   They represent
tag/value pairs.  The first string is the name of the tag.  The second is
the tag's value.
