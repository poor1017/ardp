# According to the gcc.info page, -W turns on things that -Wall doesn't. 
# And both together turn on yet more. Hmm. So we have compiled a lot of Prospero with both set.  --swa, 7/97

# -W gives us warnings about certain unsigned/signed comparisons.
# These are irritating, and, as of GCC 2.7.2, there is no way to turn just
# those off without turning off other good stuff too.  Right now I'm
# turning off the other good stuff too.  --swa, 7/97
# I have a discussion about the SIGNED/UNSIGNED comparison problems, in 
# the top-level BUGS file.
# CFLAGS += -W

# -Wbad-function-cast: Warn whenever a function is cast to a non-matching type.
CFLAGS += -Wbad-function-cast


# Ok, we need to turn these problems off, just for now.  This is temporary; 
# these need to be fixed, but won't for now.
# There are enough of them that it's tiring. 
# CFLAGS +=  -Wnested-externs -Wwrite-strings 
CFLAGS += -Wno-nested-externs -Wno-write-strings

# -Wno-parentheses because we haven't converted over all of Prospero to 
# use the GNU parentheses conventions for assignments inside if() statements.
# Prospero has not been written to comply with the GNU standard practices about
# parenthesizing expressions.  I did some work on this, but have set it 
# aside for now.  -swa 7/97
CFLAGS += -Wno-parentheses 

# -Wcast-qual: We turn off warnings about this for now, because we are using
# some casts to "char *" to turn off other warnings about casting to
# "const char *."
# --swa, 7/97
# CFLAGS += -Wcast-qual 
CFLAGS += -Wno-cast-qual

# We still have some functions which use old-style function declarations, so
# we don't turn on -Wstrict-prototypes, although it might be good to do so.
# CFLAGS +=-Wstrict-prototypes

# -Wconversion leads to a number of warnings.  These are mentioned in BUGS.
CFLAGS += -Wno-conversion

# Current development in ARDP means that we have many functions with unused
# arguments.  These will be later finished, with the remaining ones 
# updated with the GL_C_ARGUMENT_UNUSED macro. 
# Actually, -W is the one that complains about unused arguments, and we have to
# remove -W to turn off these complaints.
CFLAGS += -Wno-unused

# Warnings on here have been checked for most, if not all of the code.
# The server has been checked clean under -Wall on SunOS 4.1.3.

# -Wimplicit does not work on SunOS 4.1.3., because the include files 
# don't prototype all the system functions.  It was tested under Solaris 
# in 1994.

# As of early 1994, compiling with these would generate lots of warnings.
